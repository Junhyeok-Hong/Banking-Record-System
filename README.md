# Banking Record System [C++]

Project abstract from: https://www.codewithc.com/banking-record-system-project-c/ 

# Project Abstract

- Add Record
- Show/List Data
- Search Record
- Delete Record

# Objectives

- File Handling
- File as Database 

# Notes

- This new implementation does not use binary files like the source code from 'code with c'. Thus, the database file is organized in a way that is readable to humans. With the database created in such a way, the file can be transferred, read and manipulated more easily.
