Project abstract from: https://www.codewithc.com/banking-record-system-project-c/ 

# Project Abstract

- Add Record:
For this feature void read_data() function has been used to add banking record into the file. It asks for information such as account number, first name, last name and balance to be entered.

- Show/List Data:
With the information provided in add record, the void show_data() function in this banking record system project in C++ show the record corresponding to a particular account number, first name and last name. Current balance of the account holder is displayed.

- Search Record:
When the function for this feature is first executed, it shows the total records in the file, and the user can then search by record number. If the record searched for is not found, the banking record system project in C++ displays the message – “Error in opening! File Not Found!!”

- Delete Record:
First of all, when the function of this feature is executed, it shows all the records in the file, and the user can enter the record number to delete. If the record was not found, this banking record system project in C++ displays the message – “Error in opening! File Not Found!!”

# Objectives

- File Handling
- File as Database 

# Notes

- This new implementation does not use binary files like the source code from 'code with c'. Thus, the database file is organized in a way that is readable to humans. With the database created in such a way, the file can be transferred, read and manipulated more easily.
- This project was completed using Xcode
